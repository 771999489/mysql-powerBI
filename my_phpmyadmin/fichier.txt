To download and run a phpMyAdmin container using Docker, follow these steps:

Pull the latest phpMyAdmin image from Docker Hub. 
You can do this using the docker pull command, as shown below:

docker pull phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin

Run the phpMyAdmin container using the docker run command.

When you're running this command, you will need to specify the name of the container and the port that you want to use to
access phpMyAdmin. 
You will also need to link the container to a MySQL container, so that phpMyAdmin can connect to the database server.
This is an example of how you can run a phpMyAdmin container using Docker:

"docker run --name my-phpmyadmin -d --link my-mysql:db -p 8180:80 phpmyadmin/phpmyadmin"

This command will just create a container named my-phpmyadmin based on the latest phpMyAdmin image and link it to a container
named my-mysql, which should be running a MySQL server. 
We can also use the -p option maps the container's port 80 to port 8080 on the host machine.

And then we can access phpMyAdmin in a web browser. Once the container is running, you can access phpMyAdmin by visiting
 http://localhost:8180 in a web browser. 
You should see the login page for phpMyAdmin, where you can enter your MySQL username and password to log in.
